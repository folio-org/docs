In FOLIO, resource access includes essential circulation functions. These functions include:

* Checking out and discharging library materials
* Checking in materials
* Managing hold requests
* Managing course reserves
* Managing circulation logs

## Circulation Settings

The circulation of library materials is governed by a set of rules and policies.  These rules and policies are defined by the library and implemented in the [Circulation]({{< ref "/settings_circulation.md" >}}) and the [Courses]({{< ref "/settings_courses.md" >}}) areas of the FOLIO Settings app.
