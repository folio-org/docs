## Settings > Notes > General

Note types are categories you can create for notes to indicate the type of note they are. Notes have associated types that can be used to categorize the note. This area of Settings is where you configure note types. The note types you create here appear throughout FOLIO. They are not app specific. This means that note types can be used in different apps, even if they were created with a particular app in mind.

2. In the **Note type** column, enter a **name** for the note type in the box.

### Editing a note type

1. Find the note type you want to edit, and in the **actions** column, click the **pencil icon**.
2. In the **Note type** column, make your desired changes to the **name.**
3. Click **Save**. The note type is updated.

### Deleting a note type

1. Find the note type you want to delete.
