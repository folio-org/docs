## Settings \> Users \> Permission sets

Use this setting to create permission sets for your library. Permission sets are customized collections of permissions that can be assigned to users. For example, you can create permission sets that correspond to specific job roles and assign the set, rather than each individual permission, to all library staff with that role.

Additionally, if permissions change because of a new release, a FOLIO administrator can edit the permission set for a particular role to update the assigned permissions. The change to the permission set then propagates out to the users who have that permission set assigned, and the administrator doesn't have to update permissions for each individual user.

### Creating a permission set

1.  In the **Permission sets** pane, click **New**.
2.  To name the permissions set, enter a **Permission set name**.
3.  Optional: Enter a **Description** of the permission set.
4.  Under **Assigned permissions**, click **Add permission**. You can assign individual permissions or existing permission sets to the new permission set. 
5.  In the **Select Permissions** modal, search and filter by **Permission type** and/or **Permission assignment status** or type in the name of the permission or permission set into the search box. 
6. Select the permission(s) or permission set(s) to assign to the new permission set. 
7.  Click **Save & close**. The permission(s) or permission set(s) are added to the new permission set.
8.  Click **Save & close**. The new permission set is saved.

### Editing a permission set

1.  In the **Permission Sets** pane, find the permission set you want to edit and select it.
2.  Click **Edit**.
3.  Make your desired changes to the permission set.
4.  Click **Save & Close**. 

### Deleting a permission set

Note: A permission set can be deleted even if it is currently assigned to a user. Deleting the permission set removes it from the users to whom it was assigned.

1.  In the **Permission Set** pane, find the permission set you want to delete and select it.
2.  Click **Edit**.
3.  In the **Edit** window, click **Delete**.
4.  In the **Delete permission set?** dialog, click **Delete**. A confirmation message appears and the permission is deleted.

## Settings \> Users \> Patron Groups

## Settings \> Users \> Owners
 A Fee/fine owner is the agent or office that manages fines for FOLIO transactions. Fee/fine owners collect fees/fines for FOLIO service points.

Libraries may use owners in different ways, such as creating a fee/fine owner for each service point, or creating a fee/fine owner for each library's accounting office, that may collect fee/fines for multiple service points. 

If your library intends to charge any fines, it is important that *every service point* be assigned to a fee/fine owner, even if you do not expect fines to accrue for items associated with that service point. Making sure that the service point is assigned to an owner will prevent unexpected errors from occurring.

When manually creating a fee/fine, Fee/fine owner is a required field.

## Settings \> Users \> Conditions

The block is automatically removed once the patron falls below the limit.
