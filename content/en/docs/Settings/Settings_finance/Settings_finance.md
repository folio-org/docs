The Finance section of the Settings app is where you establish and specify the categories you want to use to classify the different fund types that will be used during a fiscal year.


## Permissions

In order to interact with Finance settings, a user needs to be assigned the following permission:



*   **Settings (Finance): Can view and edit settings.** This permission allows the user to view, create, edit, and delete all finance settings.

Note: This is the only permission available for Finance settings. With some other Finance permissions, the user is able to view the settings, but they are unable to create, edit, or delete the settings. You can assign permissions to users in the Users app.


## Settings > Finance > Fund types

A fund type is a categorization to help distinguish between the purpose of the different funds. You can use fund types to track the types of items funds are applied to, such as gifts, endowments, and exchanges. You need to first add the fund types in the Settings app in order to assign them to funds as fund types are created within the system. Fiscal year rollover of funds is often defined by fund type, so definition of the type values should consider future fiscal year rollover requirements.

For more information on adding funds and fund information, see Creating a new fund.
