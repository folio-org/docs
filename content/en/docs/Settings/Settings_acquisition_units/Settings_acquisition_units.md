The Acquisition units section of the Settings app is where you can configure your acquisition units and assign users to the units you created.

Acquisition units are an additional layer you can add to acquisitions records that restrict a user’s ability to interact with those records unless they have been assigned to that unit. While acquisition permissions may allow a user to perform certain actions within a particular app to any record within that app, acquisition units can further limit user access to only individual records.

For example, a university that shares FOLIO across multiple independent libraries, such as a Law Library, Medical Center Library, and Undergraduate Library could set up separate acquisition units for each library and assign staff from each library to the appropriate unit. Only staff within an assigned acquisition unit could take allowed actions on orders, organizations, invoices, or funds that share the same acquisition unit assignment. Even if a Law Library user has permissions to create and delete records within the Finance app, they would still be restricted from creating or deleting a Medical Center Library fund if they are not assigned to the Medical Center Library acquisition unit.

Acquisitions units can be applied to the following types of records in FOLIO:

*   Fiscal years
*   Ledgers
*   Groups
*   Funds
*   Invoices
*   Orders
*   Organizations

Note: Restricting the actions of users based on acquisition units is not fully functional in the following apps: Finance and Receiving. However, you can still add acquisition units to records within those apps.


## Permissions

In order to interact with acquisition units settings, a user needs to be assigned the following permission:



*   **Settings (acquisition units): Can view, edit, create and delete settings.** This permission allows you to manage acquisition unit settings.

Note: This is the only permission available for acquisition unit settings. You can assign permissions to users in the Users app.


## Keyboard shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts allow you to perform actions in this setting using the keyboard.  See [Platform essentials > Keyboard shortcuts]({{< ref "/keyboardshortcuts.md" >}}) for more information.


## Creating an acquisition unit

2. Enter the **Name** of the unit in the box.

3. Select the types of actions members in the unit can perform:

*   **Edit.** Users assigned to the unit are the only ones who can edit records that have the unit assigned.
*   **Create.** Users assigned to the unit are the only ones who can add the unit to a record they are creating.
