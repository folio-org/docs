The Calendar section of the Settings app is where you edit open and closed hours for the library service points. 

The Check out app references the logged-in userâ€™s service point when loaning items to patrons and calculating their due dates. That means that the service point must have an existing calendar that covers the time period that the item is being loaned for in order for the check out to be successful.
