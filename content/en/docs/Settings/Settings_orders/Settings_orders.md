## Settings > Orders > Inventory interactions

Use this setting to determine how materials you are ordering interact with the Inventory app. The settings you select here determine the default interaction based on the Order format (Electronic, Physical, P/E Mix, or Other) you select for the order line item. The interactions you select can be changed when you add or edit an order line, in the Create inventory field of the Physical resource or E-resource details section of the order line, if needed.

There are four default interactions you can select:



*   **Instance, holdings, item.** Once the order is opened, an instance, holdings, and item are found or created in the Inventory app.
*   **Instance.** Once the order is opened, an instance is found or created in the Inventory app.
*   **Instance, holdings.** Once the order is opened, an instance and holdings are found or created in the Inventory app.
*   **None.** Nothing is found or created in the Inventory app.


## Settings > Orders > Instance status

Use this setting to determine the instance status that is assigned to the instances that are created through opening an order. Note: If you have not selected a default, then you may encounter problems when trying to receive an item or when you close an order.

For information on managing instance status values, see Settings > Inventory > Instances > Instance status types.

## Settings > Orders > Order templates

Use this setting to configure your order templates. Order templates can be used to populate consistent information that you may always fill out when ordering from a specific vendor, for example. Note: Any order templates you create are shared among all users who have permission to create orders.

Order templates contain the same fields found in order records but also include order line information, which is automatically applied to any order lines added to the order record that uses the order template.


### Creating an order template

To create a new order template, follow the steps below.  To hide a field from view during order creation, click on the eye icon beside the field name.  The eye icon will display an angled slash mark to indicate that the field will be hidden.  When the user creates a new order and selects the template, only the fields with the eye turned on will display. Note: Template name is the only required field for a new order template.

1. Click **New**.

2. Click **Hide all eligible fields** to turn off visibility for all fields that can be hidden during order creation.  You can then turn on only the fields that you want to display by unselecting the eye icon beside those fields.

3. Fill in information as needed for the remaining order creation fields. Follow the instructions under [Creating an order]({{< ref "/orders.md#creating-an-order" >}}) for more information. Click on the eye icon to hide fields as needed.
