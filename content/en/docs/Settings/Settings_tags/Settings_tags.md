The Tags section of the Settings app is where you enable the use of tags in FOLIO apps.

## Permissions

To interact with Tag settings, a user needs to be assigned the following permission:

* **Settings (Tags): Can enable or disable tags for all apps.** This permission allows the user to enable or disable tags globally in FOLIO.

Note: This is the only permission available for Tags settings. You are unable to view and access Tags settings if you do not have this permission assigned to you. You can assign permissions to users in the Users app.

## Allowed characters

Tags cannot be saved with space characters or pipe characters (|). They are removed before the tag is created. 

Upper case characters will be converted to lower case when the tag is saved.
