quickMARC is FOLIO's MARC editing tool, which allows you to make edits to instance and holdings records with underlying MARC records. For all instances or holdings whose source record is a MARC record you have the option to edit the MARC using quickMARC. quickMARC saves to Source Record Storage (SRS) and updates both the Source Record and the corresponding Inventory record. quickMARC has minimal validation and is best used in addition to other cataloging tools.

Note: quickMARC is a module that you can access through the Inventory app; it is not its own app. For more information, see Accessing quickMARC.

Definition of terms related to quickMARC:

-   **Instance record.** A record that contains bibliographic and administrative information about a particular resource. The Instance record is what is known as the bibliographic record. They are mostly derived from full bibliographic records (in MARC or other formats) and are intended to provide information for library staff to identify and select records in order to perform work on associated holdings and items. 
-  **Holdings record.** A record that contains information such as location, call number, and volumes owned, that enables staff to locate and manage library holdings for materials in all formats. A Holdings record must be associated with an Instance record.
-   **SRS.** Source Record Storage. A storage layer in FOLIO. If an instance or holdings has an underlying MARC record, then this record is stored in SRS.

Tags must consist of 3 numeric characters.

-   Fields 005 and 999ff are system supplied and cannot be edited or deleted.
-   The Leader must contain 24 characters, including null spaces
-   Only positions 5, 8, 17, 18, and/or 19 in the Leader can be edited
-   008 bytes Type and BLvl must match positions 6 and 7 in the Leader 
-   245 is required and non-repeatable

### Record status

The record status shows the state of the MARC record in relation to the corresponding Inventory record and the SRS. You can view the record status at the top of the Edit MARC record window. When a MARC record is saved in quickMARC, any changes made to the record are reflected in SRS and in the corresponding Inventory record.

There are three record statuses:

-   **Current.** The record is up to date and should be the same as the Inventory record and SRS.
-   **In progress.** A change has been made to the record that has not made it to the Inventory record and/or SRS yet.
-   **Error.** Something is preventing an update from moving to the Inventory record or SRS.

## Creating a new MARC record using quickMARC

### To create a new **MARC bibliographic record**, derive a new record from an existing MARC record.

1.  Start with an instance record that has an underlying MARC source record and the same [Resource type](../inventory/#resource-type) and [Format](../#format) as the record you wish to create.
2.  Click **Actions \> Derive new MARC bibliographic record.**
3.  Edit the new record following the instructions in [Editing a MARC record using quickMARC](#editing-a-marc-record-using-quickmarc).

### To create a new **MARC holdings record**

1.   [Find the instance record](../#searching-for-a-record) to which you want to add holdings and select it. The instance source must be MARC.
2.  Click **Actions \> Add  MARC holdings record.** 
3.  Edit the new record following the instructions in [Editing a MARC record using quickMARC](#editing-a-marc-record-using-quickmarc).
