The Inventory app allows you to manage your collections (physical and/or virtual). Inventory stores bibliographic, holdings, and item data in the form of Instance, Holdings, and Item records. Instance records may be created within FOLIO or generated from records in source record storage (SRS). Data within Inventory integrates with other apps like Orders, Check in, Check out, and Requests.

Definition of terms related to the Inventory app:

-   **Instance record.** A record that contains bibliographic and administrative information about a particular resource. The Instance record is what is known as the bibliographic record. They are mostly derived from full bibliographic records (in MARC or other formats) and are intended to provide information for library staff to identify and select records in order to perform work on associated holdings and items.
-   **Holdings record.** A record that contains information such as location, call number, and volumes owned, that enables staff to locate and manage library holdings for materials in all formats. A Holdings record must be associated with an Instance record.
-   **Item record.** A record that contains information needed to identify and track a single item or piece. The Item record contains data specific to a single volume or piece, such as barcode and circulation status. An Item record must be associated with a Holdings record.
-   **HRID.** Human readable identifier, also called eye readable ID.
-   **UUID.** Universally unique identifier.
-   **SRS.** Source Record Storage. A storage layer in FOLIO. If an instance has an underlying MARC record, then this record is stored in SRS.
-   **Intellectual item.** This status can be used for an item record that does not correspond to a single, distinct physical object. May also be referred to as a “dummy record.”

## Creating an instance record manually in FOLIO

1.  In the Inventory pane, click **Actions \> New**.
2.  In the **New Instance** window, fill in the Administrative data, Title data, Identifier, Contributor, Descriptive data, Instance notes, Electronic access, Subject, Classification, Instance relationship (analytics and bound-with), and Related instances sections. For more information on the fields and actions available in these sections, see the section descriptions below.
3.  Once you have included all of the information you want in the instance record, click **Save & close**. The instance record is saved.

### Administrative data

The Administrative data section contains technical information about the instance record.

-   **Suppress from discovery.** If you want to suppress the record from your discovery layer, select the **Suppress from discovery** checkbox.
-   **Staff suppress.** If you want to suppress the record, and its associated holdings and item records, from staff who do not have the proper permissions to view the record, select the **Staff suppress** checkbox. If selected, staff need to have the permission Inventory: View instance records being suppressed for staff in order to view the record.
-   **Previously held.** If the resource was previously held by your library, select the **Previously held** checkbox. A library may adopt a policy to select the Previously held checkbox in the case where the library no longer owns the bibliographic resource described in the instance record, but for administrative reasons wishes to retain the record in the inventory and indicate previous ownership. For example, permission for library users to view or use items in a consortial collection may require proof that the library at some time owned those items.
-   **Instance HRID.** The human readable identifier, also called eye readable ID, a system-assigned sequential ID.
-   **Source (required).** Format of the instance source record, if a source record exists. For example, FOLIO if it's a record created in Inventory, MARC if it's a MARC record created in MARCcat, or EPKB if it's a record coming from eHoldings. The system assigns the source automatically.
-   **Cataloged date.** Date when an instance is considered "cataloged."
-   **Instance status term.** Select the instance status type to be assigned to the record. For example, the instance status may be: cataloged, uncataloged, batch loaded, or not yet assigned. Instance status types are configured by your library in the Settings app. See [Settings \> Inventory \> Instance](../../settings/settings_inventory/settings_inventory/#settings--inventory--instance-status-types) status types for more information.
-   **Mode of issuance.** A bibliographic categorization reflecting whether a resource is issued in one or more parts, the way it is updated, and whether its termination is predetermined or not. You can configure the values that appear in the drop-down list in [Settings \> Inventory \> Modes of issuance](../../settings/settings_inventory/settings_inventory/#settings--inventory--modes-of-issuance). For records created in FOLIO, you may assign a value, but for instance records with an underlying MARC record in the SRS database the value is determined from the MARC fixed field values.
-   **Statistical code.** Statistical codes are locally assigned values used to filter and sort records. Multiple statistical codes can be added to a record. Statistical codes are configured by your library in the Settings app. See [Settings \> Inventory \> Statistical codes](../../settings/settings_inventory/settings_inventory/#settings--inventory--statistical-codes) for more information.

You can search for instance, holdings, or items by clicking on either **Instance**, **Holdings**, or **Item** in the **Search & filter** pane. The elements available for searching and filtering are different based on your selection, but the results always display instance records.

To search, first select the record type (instance, holdings, or item); enter your search terms into the box and click **Search**. Select the **Keyword (title, contributor, identifier)** drop-down list to search through one of the following:

-   **Keyword (title, contributor, identifier)**. Keyword search through title, contributor, and identifier fields.
-   **Contributor.** Keyword search through all contributor fields. 
-   **Title (all).** Keyword search through all title fields. This includes searching the equivalent of title proper, alternative titles (including uniform titles) and, series titles, but not preceding and succeeding titles.

-   **ISBN.** Searches the number exactly as it appears in the data. For example, if there are hyphens in the data, the hyphens must be entered in the search.
-   **ISSN.** Searches should include hyphens.
-   **Subject.** Keyword search through all subject fields. This may include Library of Congress Subjects, FAST, and other subject vocabularies, including Genre/Form terms.
-   **Instance HRID.** Human readable identifier for the record.
-   **Instance UUID.** Universally unique identifier for the record.
-   **All.** Searches across all fields in all record types. May impact performance.
