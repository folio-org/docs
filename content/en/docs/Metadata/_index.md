In FOLIO, metadata management includes essential cataloging functions. These functions include:

- Creating Instance, Holdings, and Item records
- Managing your collections (physical and/or virtual)
- Importing and exporting bibliographic data
- Editing MARC records

## Cataloging Settings

Metadata management is governed by a set of rules and policies. These rules and policies are defined by the library and implemented in the [Data export](../settings/settings_data_export/settings_data_export/), [Data import](../settings/settings_data_import/settings_data_import/), and [Inventory](../settings/settings_inventory/settings_inventory/) areas of the FOLIO Settings app.
