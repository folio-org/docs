Keyboard shortcuts facilitate actions. For the [apps listed below](#list-of-apps-displaying-the-shortcut-list), you can [view the available shortcuts](#viewing-the-keyboard-shortcuts-list) while using the app. Note: Most apps do not use all the listed shortcuts. For example, **Alt+c** does not work in the **Users** app because currently you cannot duplicate a record in the Users app. 

The action associated with the shortcut may vary slightly for different apps -- for example, in the **Dashboard** app **Alt+n** is **Create a new widget**.

## Viewing the keyboard shortcuts list 

To view the list of available shortcut keys, follow these steps:
 
Click on the name of a FOLIO app from the top menu bar.  The app opens and the app name displays at the top left of the window.
 
Click on the downward-facing caret, “v”, at the end of the app name.  
 
Click **Keyboard shortcuts** to view the list of shortcut actions.

Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Alt+k after opening the app (this works in all [listed apps](#list-of-apps-displaying-the-shortcut-list) except for **eUsage**).
