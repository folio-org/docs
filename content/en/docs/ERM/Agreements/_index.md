The Agreements app allows you to create and manage your library’s agreements. The agreements you create here can link to licenses in the Licenses app.

Definition of terms related to the Agreements app:



*   **Agreement.** An agreement is a place where you can manage the content your library can access (based on resources described in a knowledge base) and link that content to licensing and acquisitions information.
*   **External knowledge base.** A knowledge base (see definition in this list) that is outside of the FOLIO system. For example, the EBSCO knowledge base.
*   **Internal knowledge base.** Managing your library’s knowledge base from within FOLIO.
*   **Knowledge base (KB).** A knowledge base is an extensive database maintained by a knowledge base supplier that contains information about electronic resources such as title lists and coverage dates etc. Knowledge bases typically organize the resources provided by a content provider into collections or databases that reflect specific content provider offerings, for example packages of e-journals, e-books, or other materials.
*   **License.** A license explains what you can do with the content your library can access. The license is the contract or Terms of Use.

Library’s utilizing FOLIO can employ an external knowledge base, like EBSCO, or use FOLIO’s internal knowledge base. Note: Some instructions differ depending on your library’s use of an external or internal knowledge base.

*   If only a single agreement period is used, no other information is displayed in relation to periods.
*   If you add multiple periods to the record, their dates cannot overlap.
*   Each period must have a start date.
*   The earliest period start date is treated as the agreement start date.
*   End dates are optional, but only one period in a set can be left without an end date. This is referred to as an open-ended period, which has a start date but is assumed to continue for an indefinite amount of time.
*   The latest period end date is treated as the agreement end date, or if there is a blank period end date the agreement is treated as having no end date.
*   You can navigate between past, present, and future periods by clicking on the **Previous**, **Current**, or **Next** buttons.


#### Adding an agreement period



1. Enter the agreement period’s **Start date**.
2. Fill in the rest of the fields. See below for more information. The agreement period saves once you save the agreement.

2. Click the **trash can icon**. The Agreement period is deleted and is removed from the record once you save the agreement.


### Internal contacts

Internal contacts are generally the people within your library that you need to contact if you have questions about the agreement. For example, you may want to add the ERM librarian responsible for renewals, the authorized signatory for an agreement, or the subject matter expert responsible for reviewing content ahead of renewals. Multiple contacts can be assigned to a record, but each contact you add must have a user record in the Users app.


#### Adding an internal contact



1. Click **Add internal contact.**
2. Click **Link user.**
3. In the **Select User** dialog, enter the user’s name or portion of a name into the search box in the **User Search** pane, and click **Search.** User Search Results appear.

2. Click the **trash can icon**. The Internal contact is removed from the record once you save the agreement.


### Agreement lines

An agreement line represents the material covered by the agreement, for example, a package or title. If you want to add agreement lines, you should save your progress on the agreement record you are creating or wait until you have completed and saved all agreement information before you start the agreement line process. For instructions on adding agreement lines to a record, see [Adding an agreement line](#adding-an-agreement-line).


### License information

In the License information section, you can link your agreement record to a license record. There are two types of licenses you can add in this section: license records created in the Licenses app or external license records (for example, licenses maintained by a consortium).

Note: You can add multiple license records to an agreement record, but only one can be the Controlling license. All other licenses must be designated as Historical or Future. For more information, see step 6 under [Adding a license created in the Licenses app to an agreement](#adding-a-license-created-in-the-licenses-app-to-an-agreement).


#### Adding general notes about the license



*   At the top of the License information section, you can add **General notes about the agreement’s license** into the box.


#### Adding a license created in the Licenses app to an agreement

Note: If the license you link to the agreement has amendments present, once you link the license the amendments also display. They also need to have a status in relation to the agreement set. This is important as it is the combination of the applicable (controlling) licenses and amendments that dictate the terms that apply to the agreement.



1. Click **Add license**.
2. Click **Link license**.
3. In the **Select license** dialog, enter the license’s name or a portion of the name into the search box in the **Search & filter** pane, and click **Search**. Search results appear in the Licenses pane.

6. Select the **Status (this agreement)** from the drop-down list: Controlling, Future, or Historical. Note: Only one license can have the status Controlling in relation to the agreement at one time. Controlling means the terms in the license are applied to the agreements right now. It is the terms from the Controlling license that are displayed as the agreement license terms in the agreement details pane. Future means that the license becomes controlling at some point in the future. Historical means that the license was the controlling license at some point in the past.
7. (Optional) Enter any notes about the license in the **Note** box.
8. Repeat steps 1-7 as needed. The license saves once you save the agreement.

## Adding an agreement line

An agreement line represents the material covered by the agreement, for example, a package or title. The steps for adding agreement lines vary depending on whether your library is using the internal KB or an external KB.


### Adding an agreement line via the internal KB

When using the internal KB, you first have to add e-resources to a basket in the E-resources pane. Then, you can apply those e-resources to agreement lines.


#### Adding e-resources to the basket

Before you can add e-resources to agreement lines in an existing or new agreement, you must first add them to a basket. The basket is a temporary container that holds any e-resources (titles or packages) with which you need to work. E-resources are added on a one-by-one basis to an agreement line, so you can add as many e-resources to the basket as you need.



1. In the **Search & filter** pane, click **E-resources**.
2. Search for the e-resource you want to add to the basket.
3. In the **E-resources** pane, click on the e-resource to select it.
4. In the **e-resource details** pane, click **Options for acquiring e-resource**.
5. In the **Options** table, in the **Actions** column, click **Add title** or **Add package** to add that e-resource to the basket. The e-resource is added to the basket and the number of items in the basket updates.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 for all e-resources you want to add to the basket.

### Adding a purchase order line to an agreement line

When an agreement line is linked to a POL that is linked to an Inventory instance, a link directly to the Inventory instance is displayed in the Agreement Line display.

### Dashboard widgets for the Agreements app

The Dashboard app is designed to enable a personalized view of key information from across FOLIO apps at a glance. In its first release (included in the Juniper flower release), the Dashboard includes the ability to display information from the Agreements and Licenses applications.

In the Juniper release, the Agreements app comes with two dashboard widgets ("ERM Agreements" and "ERM Agreement Jobs"). There are examples of how you can use these two widget definitions to achieve a wide range of outcomes in the [Example widget configurations](https://wiki.folio.org/display/FOLIOtips/Example+widget+configurations) documentation.
