The eHoldings app allows you to manage your library’s e-resources. You can link your e-resources to agreements created in the Agreements app to create a relationship between the two.

Definition of terms related to the eHoldings app:



* **E-resource.** An electronic resource. This generally refers to packages and titles.
* **Knowledge base (KB)** A knowledge base is an extensive database maintained by a knowledge base supplier that contains information about electronic resources such as title lists and coverage dates etc. Knowledge bases typically organize the resources provided by a content provider into collections or databases that reflect specific content provider offerings, for example packages of e-journals, e-books, or other materials.
* **Providers.** The provider of the e-resource, for example, the vendor or publisher.
* **Packages.** A collection of e-resource titles bundled together as a unit and distributed by a provider.
* **Titles.** The individual e-resources, for example a journal or e-book, contained within a package.


## Permissions

The permissions listed below allow you to interact with the eHoldings app and determine what you can or cannot do within the app. You can assign permissions to users in the Users app. If none of these permissions are assigned to a user, they are unable to see the eHoldings app or any related information.

The following are all the eHoldings permissions:



* **eHoldings: Can create and delete custom packages and titles.** This permission allows the user to create and delete custom packages and titles.
* **eHoldings: Can edit providers, packages, titles detail records.** This permission allows the user to edit providers, packages, and titles detail records.

* **Settings (eholdings): View Usage Consolidation API credentials.** This permission allows the user to view usage consolidation settings.

## Keyboard shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts allow you to perform actions in this app using the keyboard.  See [Platform essentials > Keyboard shortcuts]({{< ref "keyboardshortcuts.md" >}}) for more information.



## Implementing eHoldings

When you use eHoldings, the data is held in an external knowledge base (KB) and you're interacting with that knowledge base through eHoldings using an API call. eHoldings is connected to an EBSCO knowledge base API called HoldingsIQ to get external KB data. You can make changes in FOLIO eHoldings or EBSCO Holdings Management and they are immediately reflected on the other interface. Currently EBSCO is the only supported external KB.

To setup eHoldings:



1. Subscribe to EBSCO's HoldingsIQ API.
2. [Request an API key](https://developer.ebsco.com/knowledge-services/holdingsiq/reference).
3. Go to FOLIO > Settings > eHoldings to enter API credentials and EBSCO customerID.

2. A menu appears with the following options:



    * **eHoldings app Search.** This option will return you to the eHoldings app landing page.
