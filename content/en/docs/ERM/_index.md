In FOLIO, ERM includes essential functions. These functions include:

* Creating and managing agreements
* Creating and managing licenses
* Managing an external or internal knowledge base
* Managing your libraryâ€™s electronic resources

## ERM Settings

Parts of the ERM apps are customizable by your library. These configurations are defined by the library and implemented in the [Agreements](../settings/settings_agreements/settings_agreements/), [eHoldings](../settings/settings_eholdings/settings_eholdings/), and [Licenses](../settings/settings_licenses/settings_licenses/) areas of the [FOLIO Settings](../settings) app.
