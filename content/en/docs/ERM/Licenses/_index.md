The Licenses app allows you to create and manage your library’s licenses. The licenses you create here can link to agreements in the Agreements app.

Definition of terms related to the Licenses app:



*   **Agreement.** An agreement outlines the content your library can access.
*   **License.** A license explains what you can do with that content. The license is the contract or Terms of Use.
*   **Organization.** Any institution with which your library interacts (this may or may not be an institution from which you purchase materials). The organizations associated with licenses are generally the licensors or a consortium.


## Permissions

The permissions listed below allow you to interact with the Licenses app and determine what you can or cannot do within the app. You can assign permissions to users in the Users app. If none of these permissions are assigned to a user, they are unable to see the Licenses app or any related information.

The following are the Licenses permissions:



*   **Licenses: Search & view licenses.** This permission allows the user to search and view existing licenses and amendments. This includes the permission to see and access the License app in the FOLIO interface.
*   **Licenses: Edit licenses.** This permission grants all permissions included in "Licenses: Search & view licenses" plus it allows the user the ability to edit licenses and amendments, including the ability to add and edit documents and view, add and edit tags on a license.
*   **Licenses: Delete licenses.** This permission grants all permissions included in "Licenses: Search & view licenses" plus it allows the user the ability to delete licenses and amendments.
*   **Licenses: File download.** (ui-licenses.licenses.file.download) This permission grants permission for document downloads, as separate from document uploads.
*   **Settings (Licenses): Manage pick lists and values.** This permission allows the user to access the License settings and the ability to manage pick lists and pick list values.
*   **Settings (Licenses): Manage license terms.** This permission allows the user to access the License settings and the ability to manage the available terms. It includes the ability to view pick list information, which is necessary to manage license terms which use pick lists.

If you want to link or view organizations and/or internal contacts in a license record, you also need to have the following Organizations and Users permissions:



*   **Organizations: View.** This permission allows the user to search and view organization records and settings. The user can also access Contacts and Interfaces but cannot access Interface usernames and passwords.
*   **Organizations: Interface usernames and passwords: view.** This permission allows the user to view the usernames and passwords that appear in the Interface section.
*   **Users: Can view user profile.**

### Core documents

A core document is any central document relevant to the license record, for example, the license agreement or terms of use.

It can also be used as a space to upload documents for easier access when assessing license information in FOLIO.

2. Enter a **Name** in the box.
3. (Optional) Enter a **Note** about the core document.

### Terms

Terms are the terms of use that define what you can or cannot do with the licensed content. In FOLIO, you can define the Terms that appear in license records through configurations in the Settings app. The Settings app is where you establish the term label, the type of term, default visibility of the term, and term status (primary or optional). For more information, see [Settings > Licenses > Terms]({{< ref "/settings_licenses.md#settings--licenses--terms" >}})


Primary terms appear on every license record by default. Optional terms can be added on a license-by-license basis.


#### Filling out a primary term

If a term is defined as primary in the Settings app, then it always appears as an option in a license record. You can leave the **Value** of a primary term blank or select **Not set**, but primary terms cannot be removed from the license record.



1. Complete the **Value** field either by inputting text, using the up and down arrows to set an integer, or selecting an option from the drop-down list. The value is the definition of, or answer to, the term.
2. (Optional) Enter an **Internal note** in the box. Any text you enter here displays internally to FOLIO users.
3. Select the term’s **Visibility** from the drop-down list. Visibility indicates whether the term should display internally (only within FOLIO), or externally to the public through, for example, your catalog.
4. (Optional) Enter a **Public note** in the box. Any text you enter here displays externally to the public.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for as many primary terms as desired. The terms save once you save the license.


#### Adding an optional term

A term is optional if it is not defined as primary in the Settings app. Optional terms do not automatically display in a license record.



1. Click **Add term.**
2. Select the term **Name** from the drop-down list.

### Supplementary documents

A supplementary document is any additional document relevant to the license record.


#### Adding a supplementary document



1. Click **Add supplementary document.**
2. Enter a **Name** in the box.
3. Select a **Category** from the drop-down list. Categories for Supplementary documents can be configured in the Settings app under [Licenses > License term pick list setup]({{< ref "/settings_licenses.md#settings--licenses--pick-lists" >}}).
4. (Optional) Enter a **Note** about the supplementary document.
5. You must complete at least one of the following:
    *   Upload a file into the license record by dragging and dropping the file in the **Drag & drop to upload** box, or click **or choose file**.
    *   Enter the **Physical location** of the document in the box.
    *   Enter the **URL** of the document in the box.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 as needed. The supplementary document saves once you save the license.

### Dashboard widgets for the Licenses app

The Dashboard app is designed to enable a personalized view of key information from across FOLIO apps at a glance. In its first release (included in the Juniper flower release), the Dashboard includes the ability to display information from the Agreements and Licenses applications.

In the Juniper release, the Licenses app comes with one dashboard widget ("ERM Licenses"). There are examples of how you can use this  widget definition to achieve a wide range of outcomes in the [Example widget configurations](https://wiki.folio.org/display/FOLIOtips/Example+widget+configurations) documentation.
