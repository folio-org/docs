The Finance app allows you to create fund structures and manage money.

Definitions of terms used in the Finance app:   



*   **Acquisition units.** An additional layer you can add to acquisitions records that restricts a user’s ability to interact with those records unless they have been assigned to that unit. For example, you may create acquisition units to represent the different libraries within your library system. Units are defined and determined by your library in the Settings app. See [Settings > Acquisition units]({{< ref "/settings_acquisition_units.md" >}}) for more information.
*   **Amount allocated.** The amount of money assigned to a fund at the start of a fiscal year. Additional money can also be allocated during the year.
*   **Budget.** A finance record that describes the amount of money available for a fiscal year within a fund that includes a definition of the allowed expenditure percentage and allowed encumbrance percentage. Transfer and allocation transactions are performed against a budget. Expense classes can be assigned to a budget.
*   **Encumbrance.** An amount of money that the library commits to pay to a vendor from a fund’s budget for ordered materials that are invoiced in the future.
*   **Expense class.** A fiscal entity used to track transactions against a specific purpose or function within a Fund. Optional, tenant-defined, and can be assigned to one or more funds.  Applied to order lines and invoice lines during fund distribution. Each fund can support multiple expense classes.
*   **Fiscal year.** The twelve-month period your library uses to manage its finances.
*   **Fund.** A fiscal entity used to track transactions against a general purpose or function within a ledger. Funds are associated with only one ledger. Fund information persists from year to year as new budgets are created for the fund each year.
*   **Group.** A collection of one or more funds grouped together.
*   **Ledger.** A collection of funds that need to be kept fiscally separate from another ledger’s collection of funds.  All funds within a ledger share future fiscal year rollover behavior.
*   **Net transfers.** Money transferred between funds during a fiscal year.

## Creating a fiscal year

A fiscal year is the twelve-month period your library uses for accounting and budgetary purposes. In FOLIO, a fiscal year serves as the basis for the entire fund structure and its parts. 


1. In the **Search & filter** pane, click **Fiscal year**.
2. In the **Fiscal year** pane, click **New**.
3. In the **Create fiscal year** window, enter all required information for the fiscal year. For more information on the fields and actions available in this section, see the descriptions below.
4. Click **Save & Close**. The fiscal year is saved.  


### Fiscal year information



*   **Name (required).** The name of the fiscal year. A suggested naming convention is the term “Fiscal Year” followed by the numeric year. For example, Fiscal Year 2021.
*   **Code (required).** The code must be an alpha followed by a four-digit number. It can be based on name and year. For example, FY2021.
*   **Acquisition units.** If you only want particular users within certain acquisition units to be able to edit the fiscal year, enter or select the Acquisition units from the drop-down list. You can select multiple units. If blank, any users with the appropriate permissions are allowed to edit the fiscal year information. For more information, see [Settings > Acquisition units]({{< ref "/settings_acquisition_units.md" >}})
*   **Period Begin Date (required).** The date when the fiscal year begins.
*   **Period End Date (required).** The date when the fiscal year ends.
*   **Description.** A description of the fiscal year.
Note about Currency:  The currency value does not display on the Fiscal year detail pane after creation, but the system does associate a currency with the Fiscal year based on the currency value from [Settings > Tenant > Language and localization]({{< ref "/settings_tenant.md#settings--tenant--language-and-localization" >}}). See [Viewing fund details > Fund information](#viewing-fund-details) for a description of expected system behavior for budget transaction when the Tenant currency value is changed.



## Creating a ledger

A ledger is a collection of funds that need to be kept fiscally separate from another ledger’s collection of funds. Multiple ledgers can be associated with a fiscal year and each ledger can persist in future fiscal years. A fund can be associated with only one ledger.


1. In the **Search & filter** pane, click **Ledger**.
2. In the **Ledger** pane, click **New**.
3. In the **Create ledger** window, enter all required information for the ledger. For more information on the fields and actions available in this section, see the descriptions below.
4. Click **Save & Close**. The ledger is saved.


### Ledger information



*   **Name (required).** Name of the ledger. For example, Law Library.
*   **Code (required).** User-created, based on name.
*   **Fiscal year one (required).** The first fiscal year for the ledger. Ledgers can continue to be used for multiple fiscal years. If the fiscal year does not appear in the list, you can click **New fiscal year** to create a new one.
*   **Status (required).** Select the status of the ledger: Active, Frozen, or Inactive. Active means the ledger is ongoing, Frozen means the ledger has been put on pause, and Inactive means the ledger is no longer in use.

You can select multiple units. If blank, any users with the appropriate permissions are allowed to edit the ledger's information. For more information, see [Settings > Acquisition units]({{< ref "/settings_acquisition_units.md" >}}).
*   **Enforce all budget encumbrance limits.**  This box is checked by default.  Leave this box checked if you want the system to reject any encumbrances against funds related to this ledger that would exceed the available amount of the current budget.  Uncheck this box to allow encumbrance amounts on the current year budget without restrictions.
*   **Enforce all budget expenditure limits.**  This box is checked by default.  Leave this box checked if you want the system to reject any expenditures against funds related to this ledger that would exceed the available amount of the current budget.  Uncheck this box to allow expenditure amounts on the current year budget without restrictions.
*   **Description.** A description of the ledger.


## Creating a group

Groups categorize funds and bring multiple funds together as a single group regardless of fiscal year or ledger. This enables the total amount available or allocated across multiple funds to be summarized by group, ledger, or fiscal year.



1. In the **Search & filter** pane, click **Group**.
2. In the **Group** pane, click **New**.
3. In the **Create group** window, enter all required information for the group. For more information on the fields and actions available in this section, see the descriptions below.

#### Creating a new budget

A budget is a finance record that describes the amount of money available for a fiscal year within a fund. You can create a current or planned budget for a fund from the fund details pane. To create a planned budget, one or more upcoming fiscal years must already be set up in the fiscal year series associated with the Ledger.  See  [Creating a fiscal year](#creating-a-fiscal-year) for more information.



1. In the **Search & filter** pane, click **Fund**.
2. [Find the fund](#searching-for-a-fiscal-year-ledger-group-or-fund) to which you want to add a budget and select it.
3. In the fund details pane, in the **Current budget** or **Planned budget** section, click **New**.
4. In the **Current budget** or **Planned budget** dialog, enter all the required information for the budget. For more information on the fields and actions available in this window, see the descriptions below.
5. Click **Save**. The budget is saved.


##### Budget information

*   **Fiscal year (required).** For a current budget, this value is defaulted to the current fiscal year value. For a planned budget, select a future fiscal year from the drop-down list.
*   **Status (required).** Select the status of the budget: Active, Closed, Frozen, Inactive, Planned. Active means the budget is open, Closed means the budget is closed, Frozen means the budget has been put on pause, Inactive means the fund is no longer in use, and Planned means the budget is assigned to a future fiscal year. Note: The budget must be active to successfully open an order or for an invoice to be approved and paid.
*   **Allowable expenditure percentage.** The percentage of the budget balance allowed for expenditures. Leave this field blank to allow unrestricted expenditures. A value of 100 restricts expenditures to the available balance. A value greater than 100 allows expenditures beyond the available balance. A value of 0 restricts expenditures to 0. 
*   **Allowable encumbrance percentage.** The percentage of the budget balance allowed for encumbrances. Leave this field blank to allow unrestricted encumbrances. A value of 100 restricts encumbrances to the available balance. A value greater than 100 allows encumbrances beyond the available balance. A value of 0 restricts encumbrances to 0.
*   **Allocated (required).** Enter a numeric value of money to initially allocate to the budget. Values with or without decimals are accepted (100 or 100.00). To create a budget without allocated money, enter a value of 0. Inputting a value of 0 doesn’t generate an allocation transaction. An initial allocation can be made after creating the budget. For more information, see [Allocating money to a budget](#allocating-money-to-a-budget).



#### Adding expense classes to a budget



1. [Find the fund](#searching-for-a-fiscal-year-ledger-group-or-fund) to which you want to add an expense class and select it.

### Viewing fund details

The fund details pane contains fund information and all current, planned, and previous budgets as well as expense classes associated with a fund. The budget sections in the pane display total allocated, unavailable, and available by fund and expense class. To view a list of transactions for the current budget of a fund, click **Actions > View transactions for current budget**. See [Viewing budget transactions](#viewing-transactions-for-a-current-budget) for more information.

Note that when an order is opened, the system creates an encumbrance transaction on the current budget for the fund selected in the fund distribution section of the order.  If the currency of the PO line is different than the budget currency, the encumbrance will display on the budget as a converted amount.  The budget currency is set to the Tenant currency value at the time the [Finance > Fiscal year](#fiscal-year-information) record is created; therefore, if the Tenant currency value is updated, any budgets created prior to the update will still operate based on the Tenant currency that existed when the Fiscal year associated with the budget was created.

## Rollover fiscal year


Fiscal year rollover is initiated from the ledger detail pane.  This process closes current fiscal year budgets, applies leftover amounts from the current fiscal year budgets into new upcoming fiscal year budgets based on fund type, and rolls encumbrances onto new fiscal year budgets based on order type (one-time, ongoing, and ongoing subscription). This action is applied only to the funds associated with the ledger, so rollover must be run separately for each ledger.  Run  a test of rollover to identify whether any unpaid invoices exist and to view the rollover log prior to running the actual rollover.

To run a test of fiscal year rollover, follow these steps:

1. In the **Search & filter** pane, click **Ledger.**
2. Use the search and filter tools, if needed, to find the ledger to rollover.
3. In the ledger results pane, select the name of the ledger to rollover.
4. The ledger detail pane will open. Open the Action menu and select **Rollover.**
5. In the Rollover window, complete the form to indicate your preferences for rollover settings.  For more information on the fields on the rollover screen, see the descriptions below.
6. **Save a screenshot of the completed form**.  The system does not currently retain a copy of the settings used for rollover, so it is recommended that you save a copy of the settings used for rollover for reference.
7. Click the **Test rollover** button to initiate a test of fiscal year rollover for this ledger.
8. If any unpaid invoices exist, a dialog window displays, “FOLIO has found invoices that are not yet paid or canceled. If you are sure you want to continue with rollover click continue.”  A table list of invoices displays the following information:
*   **Vendor invoice number.**
*   **Vendor.**  Organization name of the vendor.
*   **Invoice date.** 
*   **Status.**
9. Click **Cancel** to exit the dialog list without proceeding with the rollover test, click **Export list** to download a .csv file list unpaid invoices, or click **Continue** to proceed with the rollover test.
10. After continuing, a dialog displays “Please confirm that you have completed the necessary details and are ready to proceed with your rollover TEST. This process may take several minutes to complete. A link to the results will be sent to [user email address] when the process is complete.” 
11. Click **Confirm.**  A green toast message indicates that the rollover test started successfully and focus returns to the three pane layout for the ledger.  A confirmation email is sent to the user’s email address.
12. To [view the test rollover results](#viewing-rollover-log-results) in the log, open the Actions menu and select **Rollover logs.** 


To run fiscal year rollover, follow these steps:


1. In the **Search & filter** pane, click **Ledger.**
2. Use the search and filter tools, if needed, to find the ledger you want to rollover.
3. In the ledger results pane, select the name of the ledger you want to rollover.
4. The ledger detail pane will open. Click on the Action menu button and select **Rollover.**
5. In the Rollover window, complete the form to indicate your preferences for rollover settings.  For more information on the fields on the rollover screen, see the descriptions below.
6. **Save a screenshot of the completed form**.  The system does not currently retain a copy of the settings used for rollover, so it is recommended that you save a copy of the settings used for rollover for reference.
7. Click the **Rollover** button to initiate fiscal year rollover for this ledger.
8. Click **Confirm.**  Wait for the process to complete, as indicated by the blue progress bar. When complete, the “Rolling over is finished” message appears.
10. Click **Close & view ledger details** to return to the detail pane for the ledger.


### Fiscal year rollover information

When you select the **Rollover** action, the system displays the current year for the ledger at the top left of the rollover form.  The current year is based on the fiscal year period and the current date/time.

If your institution runs rollover before or after the fiscal year end date, you’ll need to return to the fiscal year tab and adjust the dates of both the fiscal year you are rolling from and the upcoming fiscal year such that the current date now fits into the fiscal year you are rolling from. Remember to readjust the fiscal year dates back to the actual fiscal year dates after rollover is complete.  See [Editing a fiscal year, ledger, group, fund, or budget records](#editing-a-fiscal-year-ledger-group-fund-or-budget-records) for more information.


*   **Period begin date.**  The fiscal year begin date for the **Fiscal year** selected.   See [Creating a fiscal year](#creating-a-fiscal-year) for more information about period dates.
*   **Period end date.** The Fiscal Year end date for the Fiscal year selected.  Note: The **Period end date** must be greater than the current date to initiate rollover from the current year to an upcoming year. 
*   **Fiscal year.**  Select the next fiscal year.  If the next fiscal year has not yet been set up, click **New fiscal year** to create one.  See  [Creating a fiscal year](#creating-a-fiscal-year) for more information.
*   **Enforce all budget encumbrance limits.** This box is checked by default. Leave this box checked if you want the system to reject any encumbrances that would exceed the available amount. For example, if your institution typically doesn’t rollover allocations and adds initial allocation amounts manually after rollover, you might want to check this box to allow current year encumbrances to be applied to the upcoming year budgets that are awaiting initial allocations.  Uncheck this box to allow encumbrance amounts on the current year budget to rollover to the upcoming year budget without restrictions based on the budget’s available amount.
*   **Enforce all budget expenditure limits.** This box is checked by default. Uncheck this box to allow expenditures to rollover even if the new budget has insufficient funds allocated.  
*   **Close all current budgets.**  This checkbox is selected by default and indicates that you want to close all the current fiscal year budgets as part of this rollover.


#### Rollover budgets 

The information in this section defines rollover behavior for budgets by fund type.  For more information about creating fund types, see [Settings > Finance > Fund types]({{< ref "/settings_finance.md#settings--finance--fund-types" >}}).  For each fund type listed, select the appropriate settings for each of the fields defined below.  These settings will be applied to all upcoming fiscal year budgets of that fund type.


*   **Rollover allocation.**  Check this box if you want the upcoming fiscal year budget initial allocation amount to equal the current fiscal year budget total allocation amount.
*   **Adjust allocation, %.**  The percentage amount to be applied to the current fiscal year budget total allocation amount to set the upcoming fiscal year's budget initial allocation amount. For example, if the current budget total allocation is $1000 and you enter two percent, the upcoming budget initial allocation value is set to $1020.
*   **Rollover budget value.**  Select which value from the current fiscal year budget to consider as the upcoming budget inital allocation value: Select **None** to ignore the current fiscal year budget values, **Available** to use the available amount, and **Cash balance** to use the remaining cash balance which is the total funding amount minus the total expended amount.  See [Viewing budget details](#viewing-budget-details) for a full description of the Available and Cash balance values.

#### Rollover encumbrances

The information in this section defines rollover behavior for encumbrances by order type: one-time, ongoing, or ongoing-subscription.  An order is considered an ongoing-subscription if the order type is **Ongoing** and the **Subscription** checkbox is checked. See [Orders > Creating an ongoing order > Ongoing order information](../orders/#ongoing-order-information) for more information about the subscription checkbox.   For each order type listed, select the appropriate settings for each of the fields defined below:

*   **Rollover.**  Check this box if you want encumbrances for open orders of this type of order to rollover to the upcoming fiscal year budget associated with each order.  Checking this box will activate the  **Based on** and **Increase by, %** fields.
*   **Based on.**  From the drop down list, select **Expended** to encumber the total amount that was expended during the current fiscal year. Select **Initial encumbrance** to encumber the purchase order line estimated price. Select **Remaining** to encumber the amount that has not yet been paid.
*   **Increase by, %.**  Enter a value if you want to increase the encumbrance amount by a defined percentage.
