The Organizations app allows you to manage information about organizations associated with your library. Organization records are a place where you can store information about an organization, including contact information, websites, interfaces, and accounts. The organizations you create are shared with the acquisitions and electronic resources management areas of FOLIO in the following apps: Orders, Invoices, Receiving, Agreements, Licenses, and eUsage.

*   **Acquisition units.** An additional layer you can add to acquisitions records that restricts a user’s ability to interact with those records unless they have been assigned to that unit. For example, you may create acquisition units to represent the different libraries within your library system. Units are defined and determined by your library in the Settings app. See [Settings > Acquisition units]({{< ref "/settings_acquisition_units.md" >}}) for more information.
*   **Organization.** Any institution with which your library interacts.  An organization may or may not be an institution from which you purchase materials.
