The Invoices app allows you to manage payment for the materials that your library ordered. You can also search for and edit existing invoices as needed.

Definitions of terms used in the Invoices app:



*   **Accounting code.** The code used by your library in your payment system in reference to an organization.
*   **Acquisition unit.** An additional layer you can add to acquisitions records that restricts a user’s ability to interact with those records unless they have been assigned to that unit. Units are defined and determined by your library in the Settings app. See [Settings > Acquisition units]({{< ref "/settings_acquisition_units.md" >}}) for more information.
*   **Adjustments.** Charges added to an invoice in addition to the materials ordered. Shipping costs and exchange rates represent common adjustments.
*   **Batch group.** Groups that process their invoices together. Invoices from the same library are generally processed together.
*   **Funds.** Specific allocations of money within a ledger.
*   **Invoice lines.** The individual line items being paid for within each invoice. Each line consists of a description of the materials being paid for, the costs incurred, and a vendor reference number. Invoices are primarily a sum of the information from these lines.
*   **Organizations.** Any institution with which your library interacts.  An organization may or may not be an institution from which you purchase materials.
*   **Vendor.** Any institution from which your library purchases materials.
*   **Vendor invoice number.** The number provided by the vendor for this invoice.
*   **Voucher number.** A number generated by the system to identify the payment request exported from FOLIO to an external financial system.

## Creating an invoice

Invoices contain a list of the payments due for materials ordered by your library from vendors.



1. In the **Invoices** pane, click **New.**
2. In the **Create vendor invoice** window, fill in the Invoice information, Adjustments, Vendor information, Extended information, and Links & documents sections. For more information on the fields and actions available in these sections, see the section descriptions below.
3. Once you have included all of the information you want about the invoice, click **Save & close.**  Note: If the user has entered an invoice number for a vendor that matches an already existing invoice number with the same invoice date, a popup window will appear with the message, "This appears to be a duplicate invoice number."  Click **Submit** to continue to create the invoice or **Cancel** to return to the Create invoice pane. 
4. The invoice is saved and added to the Invoices pane.


### Invoice information

This section contains invoice header information. Invoice date, Status, and Batch group are the only required fields in this section.



*   **Invoice date (required).** The vendor invoice date.
*   **Status (required).** The status of the invoice.  The default status for a new invoice is “Open.”  “Reviewed” is also available in the drop down list.
*   **Payment due.** The date when invoice payment is due.
*   **Terms.** The additional terms associated with the invoice, such as business or contractual terms.
*   **Approval date.** The date a user approved the invoice to move forward. This date will be generated by the system after the invoice is created and approved.
*   **Approved by.** The user who approved the invoice. The user name will display after the invoice is created and approved.
*   **Acquisition units.** The acquisition units assigned to the invoice. For more information see Settings > Acquisition units.
*   **Bill to.** In the **Bill to** drop-down list, select the billing address for the invoice. Once you select an address, the billing address appears under **Address**. Addresses are configured in the Settings app. For more information, see [Settings > Tenant > Addresses](../../settings/settings_tenant/settings_tenant/#addresses).
*   **Batch group (required).** The batch group with which the invoice will be grouped. For more information, see Settings > Invoices > Batch group configuration.
*   **Sub-total.** The sub-total of the invoice calculated as the sum of the sub-total values of all invoice lines. The system will generate this amount after the invoice is created.
*   **Total adjustments.** The total adjustments to the invoice calculated as the sum of all adjustments on the invoice header and all invoice lines. The system will generate this amount after the invoice is created.
*   **Calculated total amount.** The total amount of the invoice calculated as the sum of the **Sub-total** value and the **Total adjustments** value. The system will generate this amount after the invoice is created.
*   **Lock total** Check this box to indicate that you want to enter a total amount.  Leave this box unchecked if you want the system to calculate the total amount based on the invoice line amounts.  
*   **Lock total amount.** The total expenditure for the invoice.  This field is editable only if the **Lock total** checkbox is checked. If you enter a lock total amount, all invoice lines and adjustment values must equal this lock total amount before a user can approve the invoice.  
*   **Note.** Any additional comments relevant to the invoice.


### Adjustments

Adjustments are optional and define costs attached to an invoice beyond the items ordered. Shipping rates and exchange rates represent two common adjustments. You can either select one or more preset adjustment from the drop-down menu or create a new one.

To create preset adjustments, see [Settings > Invoices > Adjustments](../../settings/settings_invoices/settings_invoices/#settings--invoices--adjustments) for more information.


#### Selecting a preset adjustment

Select a preset adjustment from the drop down list and click **Add adjustment.** 


*   **Description (required).** Describes the adjustment.
*   **Amount (required).** The amount of the adjustment.
*   **Type.** Select a currency or a percentage. Note: This choice applies to the amount you entered in **Amount.**
*   **Pro rate (required).** Select the method by which the adjustment should be proportionally distributed: **By line**, **By amount**, **By quantity**, or **Not prorated**.  **By line** will distribute the adjustment equally across all lines regardless of the quantity on each line; **By amount** will distribute the adjustment across all line proportionally based on each line amount; **By quantity** will distribute based on quantity.  For example, if there are two invoice lines and the first has a quantity of “1” and the second line has a quantity of “2”, a **By quantity** adjustment of $3.00 will apply $1.00 to line one and $2.00 to line two.  **Not Prorated** will apply the adjustment at the invoice level rather than to each line.  If this option is selected, an “Add fund distribution” button will appear.  Click “Add fund distribution” to define the fund to which this adjustment should be applied.
*   **Relation to total (required).** Defines how this adjustment should be applied in relation to the invoice total. Select one: In addition to, Included in, or Separate from.  Note: Adjustments that are created with a **Relation to total** value of **Separate from** are not included in the **Total adjustments** amount or **Calculated total amount** for the invoice.
*   **Export to accounting.** Select this checkbox to send the adjustment detail in the voucher export to your external payment system for this invoice.

#### Creating an adjustment

If creating a new adjustment that doesn’t exist as a preset adjustment, click **Add adjustment.** Enter the adjustment details in the fields described above in  **Selecting a preset adjustment.**



### Vendor information

The vendor information section is required.

1. Enter the **Vendor invoice number** provided to you by the vendor.
2. To select the vendor, click **Organization look-up**. In the **Select Organization** dialog, find the organization record for the vendor using the search box and/or filters. Click the organization to select it.  Note: The organization selected for payment on an invoice must be a vendor.  The system will allow you to select a non-vendor organization, but you will be prevented from Approving an invoice associated with a non-vendor organization.  See [Invoices > Creating a vendor](.../.../invoices/#creating-a-vendor) for more information.
3. The vendor’s Accounting code from their Organization record summary section will display automatically once you select the vendor and save the invoice. If the vendor has multiple accounts with different accounting codes, select the appropriate accounting code  from the drop-down list. For more information about Organization accounting codes, see [Organizations > Creating an Organization](../organizations/#creating-an-organization).


### Extended information



1. Select a **Payment method** from the drop-down menu: Cash, Credit card, EFT, Deposit account, Physical check, Bank draft, Internal transfer, or Other.
2. If you want to check for existing subscriptions, select the **Check subscription overlap** checkbox. Note: System logic is not currently implemented, so the system doesn't check for overlapping subscriptions.
3. If you want to send a voucher to an external financial system, click the **Export to accounting** checkbox.  The setting of the **Export to accounting** checkbox on the vendor’s Organization record determines the default value setting of this checkbox on invoices for the vendor.  Note:  If this checkbox is set to true, then the **Accounting code** in the Vendor information section is a required field.
4. If you want to indicate to an external accounting system that an enclosure is needed with this invoice, click the **Enclosure needed** checkbox.  If the Export to accounting checkbox is set to true and a voucher is created for this invoice, the export voucher file will contain a value of true in the **Enclosure needed** data element.
4. Select a **Currency** from the drop-down list. The default value is stored in Tenant settings as the primary currency. For more information, see [Settings > Tenant > Language and localization](../../settings/settings_tenant/setting_tenant/#language-and-localization). If you select a currency other than the default, the system will display the **Current exchange rate**.
5. If you want to enter an exchange rate value to override the **Current exchange rate** value, select the **Use set exchange rate** checkbox and enter the rate in the **Set exchange rate box**.


### Links and documents

This section allows you to attach documents to an invoice record, such as digitized physical invoices or emails from vendors. You can either upload files directly or add URL links to files stored in an external file management system. You can also attach documents to accompany an invoice, such as pictures of physical invoices or emails from a vendor.


#### Add a link

1. Click **Add link**.

2. Enter a **Link name** to identify the file link.

3. Optional: Enter an **External URL** for an active website.

If you want to delete a link, click the **delete icon**.


#### Add a document

There are two ways to add a document:



*   Drag and drop a file into the box provided, or
*   Click **Choose file** to add a document from your local files.

If you want to delete a document, click the **delete icon.**

This is the end of the **Create new invoice** screen.  Click **Save & close** to save the invoice.  


You must **add or create new invoice lines** before the invoice can be approved or paid.  
*   To link an existing open order purchase order line to the invoice, follow the steps to [add an invoice line to an invoice](#adding-an-invoice-line-to-an-invoice).  Information from the purchase order line populates fields on the invoice line, such as Subscription start date, Subscription end date, and quantity. The account number and accounting code are derived from the vendor’s organization record account section. See [Organizations > Accounts](../organizations/#accounts) for more information about vendor accounts.
*   To create a new invoice line that is not associated with a purchase order, follow the steps to [create a new invoice line](#creating-a-new-invoice-line).

## Adding an invoice line to an invoice



1. Click **Add.**
2. In the **Select order lines** window, in the **Search & filter** box, enter keywords to search for the purchase order line (POL).
3. Optional: Filter results.
4. Click **Search**. Search results appear in the Search results pane.
5. To select one or more order lines, select the checkboxes to the left of the POL number.
6. Click **Save**. 
The order lines appear in the Invoice lines table.  To view an invoice line, click on a row in the Invoice lines table.  See [Viewing invoice lines](#viewing-invoice-lines) for more information.  If you select a purchase order line that contains a vendor that doesn’t match the organization for the invoice, a Confirmation dialog appears. Click **Confirm** to continue with the purchase order line selection or **Cancel** to choose a different purchase order line.

If the selected purchase order line has a payment status of **Fully paid**, a red banner will display at the top of the invoice header and a red exclamation mark icon will display beside the relevant invoice line to alert you that the purchase order selected is already fully paid.



## Creating a new invoice line

To create an invoice line that is not associated with an existing purchase order line, follow these steps:



1. Click **New.**
2. In the **Create vendor invoice line** window, fill in the Invoice information, Fund distribution, and Adjustments sections. For more information on the fields and actions available in these sections, see the section descriptions below.
3. Click **Save & close**. A confirmation message appears and the invoice line appears in the Invoice lines table.


## Linking an invoice line to a purchase order line

When vendor EDIFACT format invoices are loaded to the system through data import, invoice lines are created based on information provided from the vendor.  The system may be unable to  automatically match some invoice lines to an existing purchase order line.  To manually link an invoice line to a purchase order line, follow these steps:


1. From the vendor invoice pane, review the Invoice lines accordion to determine whether the system has automatically created a purchase order link.  A successfully linked invoice line contains a **POL number** value in the Invoice line table list.  If the **POL number** is blank, the system was unable to match to an existing purchase order.
2. To manually link the invoice line, click on the link icon to invoke a POL lookup.
3.  The **Select order lines** window opens. In the **Search & filter** box, enter keywords to search for the purchase order line (POL).
4. Optional: Filter results.
5. Click **Search**. Search results appear in the Search results pane.
6. Click on the one order you want to link to the invoice line. The **POL number** value is populated and the link is created.



### Invoice line information



*   **Description.** The description or title for the invoice line. This may contain the materials, service, or fee being invoiced.
*   **Invoice line number.** The invoice line number for the invoice line which will be created after you save this new invoice line.
*   **Status.** The status of the invoice line: Open, Reviewed, Approved, Paid, cancelled.
*   **Vendor reference numbers.** Click **Add reference number** to add vendor reference numbers for the invoice line. For more information about vendor reference numbers, see [Orders > Adding an order line to an order > Vendor ref number]({{< ref "/orders.md#vendor-1" >}}).
*   **Vendor reference type**  A type to define the vendor reference number.  Vendor continuation reference number, Vendor internal number, Vendor order reference number, Vendor subscription reference number, or Vendor title number.
*   **Subscription info.** Subscription information for this invoice line, such as which volumes are being invoiced.
*   **Subscription start date.** The date the subscription starts.  
*   **Subscription end date.** The date the subscription ends.
*   **Comment.** Any additional comments for the invoice line.

*   **Account number.** The account number for the invoice line. This drop-down list contains vendor account numbers for the vendor selected on the invoice if any exist on the vendor’s Organization record. If one or more vendor accounts exist in the Organization record for the vendor, the first account appears in this field as the default value.
*   **Quantity.** The number of items in the invoice line.
*   **Sub-total.** The amount of this invoice line. Note: The subtotal amount must be distributed to one or more funds and is expressed in the currency defined in [Settings > Tenant > Language and localization](../../settings/settings_tenant/settings_tenant/#language-and-localization).
*   **Release encumbrance.** Check this box to release the remaining value of the related encumbrance(s) from the fund to which it was assigned when the invoice transitions to **Approved** status. If this box is unchecked, any related encumbrance value that remains will persist after the invoice is **Approved** and the order payment status of any related Purchase Order Lines (POL) will not transition to **Fully Paid** until the encumbrances are released.  For example, if the POL cost was $50, but the invoice amount is $40 and **Release encumbrance** is unchecked, the $10 difference will persist as an encumbrance on the fund indicated in the fund distribution.



### Fund distribution

*   If you enter a **Lock total** value, all invoice lines and adjustment values must equal this lock total amount.  See [Invoice information > Lock total](#invoice-information) for information about lock total. 


Approving an invoice triggers the following system actions:
*   Once one or more invoices connected to a purchase order line have been “Approved,” the purchase order **Payment status** is changed to “Partially paid.”  
*   Voucher and pending payment transactions are created. Vouchers are a mechanism for providing the information necessary to make invoice payments and can be exported to an external payment system. Each invoice generates a single unique voucher on which all fund charges are grouped by the fund external account number.  For more information on exporting vouchers, see
 [Settings > Invoices > Batch group configuration](../../settings/settings_invoices/settings_invoices/#settings--invoices--batch-group-configuration).


To approve an invoice, follow these steps:



1. Find the invoice you want to approve and select it.
2. In the **Vendor invoice number** pane, click **Actions** > **Approve.**
3. In the **Approve invoice** dialog, click **Approve**. A confirmation message appears and the invoice is approved.



## Viewing a voucher


Once an invoice is approved, an invoice voucher is created and is added to the invoice record.  To view an invoice voucher, follow these steps:



1. Using the Search and Filter pane, find the invoice you want to view and select it.
2. In the **Vendor invoice number** pane, scroll down to the **Voucher information** section.  Key information about the invoice payment voucher is displayed in this section.

*   **Voucher number.**  System-assigned number for this voucher.
*   **Voucher date.** Date the invoice was approved and the voucher was created.
*   **Total.** Total amount of all voucher lines.
*   **Exchange rate.** Currency exchange rate used to generate the transaction.
*   **Disbursement number.**  The identifier from an external system corresponding to a payment.
*   **Account number.** The number of the vendor organization account for the payment method indicated on the invoice.  This value is only populated if the organization record for the vendor contains an account number in the Accounts section for the payment method being used for this invoice.
*   **Accounting code.**  Vendor accounting code to identify the vendor organization in an external accounts payable system.
*   **Enclosure needed.**  If true and payment method is “Check,” this indicates to an external accounting system that an enclosure is needed with this invoice. If the Export to accounting checkbox is set to true and a voucher is created for this invoice, the export voucher file will contain a value of true in the enclosure needed data element.
*   **Vendor.** Vendor name.
*   **Address 1.** Vendor address 1. This is the vendor’s primary address from the Organization app.  See [Organizations> Adding an address](../organizations/#adding-an-address) for more information.

*   **City.** Vendor city.
*   **State/Prov./Region.** Vendor State, Province, or Region code.
*   **Zip code.** Vendor zip code.
*   **Country.** Vendor country.



### Voucher lines



The voucher lines are grouped by fund external account number.  For example, if there are multiple invoice lines on an invoice that contain the same fund external account number, only one voucher line will be generated containing the total amount across those invoice lines.



*   **External account number.**  The fund’s external account number.
*   **Total.** The total amount for all voucher lines, displayed at the bottom of the voucher line table.


The Voucher lines table contains this information for each voucher line:

*   **Amount.**



## Printing a voucher

To print an invoice voucher, follow these steps:



1. Follow the instructions in [Viewing a voucher](#viewing-a-voucher) to find the voucher you want to print.

2. In the Voucher invoice full screen display, select **Actions** > **Print**. 

3. The print preview dialog box opens. For descriptions of each field included in the voucher print view, see [Voucher information](#voucher-information).

4. Click on the **Destination** drop-down to select whether to print the voucher or save to a PDF file.   

5. Click **Save** or **Print** as indicated by your destination selection.



## Paying an invoice



Use the **Pay** action to update the invoice to the status of Paid. The **Pay** action is available in the Action menu if the [Settings > Invoices > Approvals](../../settings/settings_invoices/settings_invoices/#settings--invoices--approvals) **Approve and pay in one click** setting is turned off.  This enables a library to use separate actions to **Approve** invoices and **Pay** invoices.  If that setting is off, the invoice must be approved before the **Pay** action will be available.  

Moving the invoice to paid status will trigger an update of the purchase order status to **Closed** once the order is fully received. See [Settings > Invoices > Approvals](../../settings/settings_invoices/settings_invoices/#settings--invoices--approvals) for more information about the “Approve and pay in one click” setting.  



To pay an invoice, follow these steps:



1. Using the Search and Filter pane, find the approved invoice that you want to pay and select it.
2.  In the Voucher invoice number pane, select **Actions** > **Pay.**
3. Click **Submit**.



## Viewing voucher export details and downloading the export file



The process to generate a batch file containing vouchers for export to an external accounts payable system is managed in [Settings > Invoices > Batch group configuration](../../settings/settings_invoices/settings_invoices/#settings--invoices--batch-group-configuration).  Only vouchers for invoices with the **Export to accounting** checkbox turned on with an invoice status of “Approved” that have not been extracted in a prior job run will be included in the export.  After the export job completes, you can view details about the export and view a copy of the full voucher export file by finding an invoice that was included in the export job.   To view voucher export details and download a copy of the full file to your local download folder, follow these steps:



1. Using the Search and Filter pane, find the invoice you want to view and select it.
2. In the **Vendor invoice number** pane, scroll down to the **Voucher export details** section.  
3. To download the full voucher export file, click the downward arrow download icon next to the Batch file name.  This file will contain all vouchers that were in a Paid status that had not yet been exported at the time of job execution.

*   The invoice voucher status is set to **Cancelled**.
*   Users are unable to Open, Approve, or Pay the invoice after cancelling.
To cancel an invoice, follow these steps:
