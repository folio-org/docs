The Orders app allows you to create and manage purchase orders.

Definition of terms related to the Orders app:


*   **Acquisition units.** An additional layer you can add to acquisitions records that restricts a user’s ability to interact with those records unless they have been assigned to that unit. For example, you may create acquisition units to represent the different libraries within your library system. Units are defined and determined by your library in the Settings app. See [Settings > Acquisition units]({{< ref "/settings_acquisition_units.md" >}}) for more information.
*   **Order.** A purchase order featuring a list of titles or packages (physical or electronic) being ordered by the library from a vendor.

## Creating an order

Orders contain a list of titles or packages (physical or electronic) being ordered by your library from a vendor.

In FOLIO, you can create either [one-time orders](#creating-a-one-time-order) or [ongoing orders](#creating-an-ongoing-order). One-time orders should be used for items fulfilled within the year, like monographs. Ongoing orders generally span multiple years, and you usually pay as you receive each item. You would want to create an ongoing order for a magazine subscription, for example.

Once you create an order, you need to [add at least one order line to the order](#adding-an-order-line-to-an-order) so the [order can be opened](#opening-an-order) and the acquisitions process can begin.


### Creating a one-time order

1. In the **Search & filter** pane, click **Orders**.

2. In the **Orders** pane, click **New**.

3. In the **Create purchase order** window, select a template from the **Template name** drop-down list, if using. The order is populated with the information configured in the template. Templates are created in the Settings app. See [Settings > Orders > Order templates]({{< ref "/settings_orders.md#settings--orders--order-templates" >}}) for more information.

4. Select **One-time** from the **Order type** drop-down list.

5. Fill in the rest of the fields under [Purchase order](#purchase-order) and [PO summary](#po-summary). For more information on the fields and actions available in these sections, see the section descriptions below.

7. Click **Save & close**. A confirmation message appears and the order appears in the Orders pane.

*   **Order format.** Select the format of the item you are ordering: Electronic resource, Physical resource, P/E mix, or Other.

*   **Receipt date.** The receipt date of the item.

Upon opening the order, the receipt status is automatically set to **Awaiting receipt**. Once an order is open, you can edit the Receipt status to **Cancelled**, **Fully received**, **Partially received**, or **Receipt not required**.

For example, you may want to select “Receipt not required” for one-time e-resource orders so that the order will automatically close once invoice payment is complete. Otherwise, if your library doesn’t receive e-resources, a one-time e-resource order may be left open even after payment is complete which could impact your expected results during Fiscal Year rollover.
*   **Payment status.** Select the payment status of the item: Payment not required or Pending. For orders with type **Ongoing**, the payment status is automatically set to **Ongoing** when the order is saved.  If no selection is made, the order is created with a payment status of **Pending**.

The Payment status is automatically set to **Partially paid** when a connected invoice line with the **Release encumbrance** checkbox unchecked/blank is set to an **Approved** status. The system will automatically close orders that have resolved both payment and receipt statuses either as Payment not required” or “Receipt not required” or by reaching “Fully paid” and “Fully received” through actions taken in the Receiving app and the Invoices app.

Note: In prior system releases, this field was a checkbox named “Manually add pieces for recieving.”
