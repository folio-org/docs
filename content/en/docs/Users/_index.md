The Users app allows you to manage user information for patrons and library staff. Both patrons and library staff's user records are stored in the Users app. There is no separate directory or app for library staff users. The difference between a library staff user and a patron is that the library staff user record has FOLIO permissions, username, and password assigned to it.

Definition of terms related to the Users app:

-   **User.** Any person who interacts with or performs tasks in FOLIO.
-   **User record.** Contains contact information and identifiers for an individual user. User records exist for both patrons and library staff. For a list of all information contained within a user record, see [Viewing a user record](#viewing-a-user-record).
-   **Permission.** Value assigned to a user, which grants them access to FOLIO records or allows them to carry out specific tasks in FOLIO.
-   **Permission set.** A group of permissions that allows a user to perform a specific set of tasks. For example, you may want to group certain permissions together to create job-specific permissions sets. Permission sets are defined by your library in [Settings \> Users \> Permission sets](../settings/settings_users/settings_users/#settings--users--permission-sets).

## Permissions

The permissions listed below allow you to interact with the Users app and determine what you can and cannot do within the app. If none of these permissions are assigned to a user, they are unable to see the User app or any related information.

## Adding a service point to a user record

A service point in FOLIO is a setting that libraries configure to support circulation functions. Every FOLIO item must have a location, and every location must have an attached service point. You must set up at least one service point to be able to check items in and out; allow patrons to request items; charge and collect fines; and put items in transit between locations at your library. 

Staff who use the Check in, Check out, Users, or Requests apps must have a service point assigned to them in their user record. Service points are configured for your library in the Settings app. See [Settings \> Tenant \> Service Points](../settings/settings_tenant/settings_tenant/#settings--tenant--service-points) for more information.

## Creating a manual patron block

Patron blocks allow libraries to manually prevent a patron from borrowing, renewing, and/or requesting materials until specified issues are resolved. Users with appropriate permissions can edit manual blocks on a patron’s record to update block information, actions, or remove the block. The block is displayed prominently on the user record so that staff members are aware that a patron is blocked and why. If an expiration date is provided on the patron block, the block is automatically removed on that date.

A patron block can be added to a user record by either selecting a patron block template or by creating a patron block. 

To create a patron block using a patron block template, follow these steps:

## Managing loans and fee/fines for patrons

From the loans section on a patron’s record, a FOLIO user with appropriate permissions can renew a loan for a patron; change the due date; mark the item claim returned; or declare the item lost. For more information about loans, see [Additional Topics \> Loans](../access/additional-topics/loans/loans/).

FOLIO users with appropriate permissions can manage fee/fines on patron accounts. This includes viewing fee/fine information, creating manual charges, accepting payment, waiving a fine, refunding a fine, and canceling a fine. For more information about fee/fines, see [Fee and fines](../access/additional-topics/feesfines/feesfines/). 


### Renew a loan

To renew one or more loans for a patron:
1. In the user record pane, expand the **Loans** accordion if needed.  
2. Click on **Open loans**. 
3. Use the check boxes on the left of the **Loans** window to select the appropriate loan(s).
4. Click the **Renew** button located in the top right corner of the **Loans** window.

If the renewal was successful, you will see a green success message in the bottom right corner. The new due date may be sooner than expected if the normal due date would be after a patron’s account has expired.
If the renewal was not successful, a pop-up message will appear. If you have the correct permissions, you can click **Override** from the pop-up window to override the error and renew the loan.

Alternatively, you can renew a loan by clicking on **Renew** in the **Actions** column. 

### Change a due date

To change due dates on one or more loans for a patron:
1. In the user record pane, open the **Loans** accordion if needed. 
2. Click on **open loans**.
3. Select the check boxes on the left of the **Loans** window to select the appropriate loan(s).
4. Click the **Change due date** button located in the top right corner of the **Loans** window. 
5. In the pop-up window that appears, enter a new due date and time or select one from the calendar drop-down.
6. Click **Save and close**.

Note that if you have permissions to change a loan’s due date, you can change the due date/time to one in the past; FOLIO will give you a warning message but allow the change to go through.

### Mark an item claim returned

Occasionally, patrons may tell libraries that they have returned items that are still listed as checked out to them. The library has the option to mark the item as “claim returned.” This will place any associated fines in a suspended state while libraries can carry out workflows to search for the item on their shelves.

To mark an item claim returned:
1. In the user record pane, expand the **Loans** accordion if needed.
2. Use the check boxes on the left of the **Loans** window to select the appropriate loan(s).
3. Click the **Claim returned** button located in the top right corner of the **Loans** window.
4. In the pop-up window that appears, enter additional information about the patron’s claim 
5. Click **Confirm**.

The loan will remain in the patron’s list of open loans, but the item status will show that the item is claimed returned.

If the library cannot locate the claimed returned item, it will need to decide whether to bill the patron for the item or mark the item missing without charging fines. In FOLIO, this action is referred to as resolving a claim.

To resolve a claim on an item:
1. Click the appropriate loan to open the *Loan details* window.
2. Click the button marked **Resolve claim** on the top row.
3. If you are going to bill the patron for the item, choose **Declare lost**. If you will not be billing the patron for the item, choose **Mark as missing**.
4. In the pop-up window that appears, FOLIO will show a message to confirm the action you wish to take. Enter any additional information about the patron’s claim (required).
5. Click **Confirm**.

If you choose to declare the item lost, FOLIO will check the associated lost item fee policy for the loan and charge fees/fines as configured in that policy.


### Mark an item declared lost

FOLIO has two options to show that an item has been borrowed and not returned - “aged to lost” and “declared lost.” Aged to lost is an automated status that FOLIO gives to an item when the item is not returned by the date specified in the lost item policy. Declared lost is a manual status that library staff can use when a patron tells the library that they cannot return the item because it is lost or damaged.

Library staff can only mark one loan declared lost at a time.

To mark a loan declared lost:
1. Click the appropriate loan to open the **Loan details** window.
2. Click **Declare lost** at the top of the window.
3. In the pop-up window that appears, enter additional information about the circumstances of the loan (required)
4. Click **Confirm**.

When an item is declared lost, FOLIO will check the associated lost item fee policy for the loan and charge fees/fines as configured in that policy. Resolving the fines will close the loan and change the item status to **Lost and paid**, even if the fines were waived. 

### Creating a manual fee/fine

Note that your library must configure fee/fine settings prior to charging fee/fines to patrons. See [Settings > Users > Owners](../settings/settings_users/settings_users/#settings--users--owners) and [Settings > Users> Manual Charges](../settings/settings_users/settings_users/#settings--users--manual-charges) for more information.

6.  In the **Fee/fine amount** box, you can do one of three things:
Keep the default fee/fine amount, if one is populated for the fee/fine type.
Adjust the default fee/fine amount, if it is populated for the fee/fine type.
Provide a fee/fine amount, if one did not populate.
7.  Optional: To associate the fee/fine with an item, scan or enter the item barcode into the **Item information** box and click **Enter**.
8.  Optional: Enter any **Additional information for staff** in the box.
9. Click **Charge only** to apply the charge to the patron record. FOLIO users with appropriate permissions may be able to create the fine and immediately accept payment by clicking **Charge & pay now**.
10.  Click either **Charge & pay now** to charge the patron and process the payment or **Charge Only** to only apply the charge to the user record.

8. Click **Refund**, then **Confirm**.

The modal will close, and the **Fee/fine details** page will update with the payment transaction.

### Mark a fee/fine as error (Cancel fee/fine)

Staff with appropriate permissions can mark a fee/fine as an error; this has the effect of cancelling the fee/fine.

Note that an error can only be applied to a fine in an **Outstanding** payment status. Marking a fine as an error is intended to be used when the fine is charged as a result of a staff or system/error and as such none of it should be paid.
